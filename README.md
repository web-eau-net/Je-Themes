### Concept

**Je Themes** plugin (pronounce Je t'aime) adds a "Templates Joomla" tab in Extensions â†’ Install and displays most of the templates available on https://templatejoomla.com

If you need or want to change the template fo your Joomla site, you'll need to search for providers online, visit numerous developer sites, test demos, compare options, etc. In the best-case scenario, you'll need to dedicate several hours of research and comparative testing.

But that was before!

Thanks to the **Je Themes** plugin, thousands of latest-generation Joomla templates are now directly accessible from your admin panel, but not installable. Filter and use the keyword search to find what you're looking for in just a few minutes.
